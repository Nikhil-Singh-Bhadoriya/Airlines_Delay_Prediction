# 🛫 Airlines Delay Prediction using Classification Algorithms

A machine learning initiative focused on predicting flight delays using classification models, flight-schedule data, and operational features.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project establishes an end-to-end pipeline: data ingestion of airline flight schedules, delays and operational attributes, exploratory analysis to uncover delay patterns, feature engineering to transform relevant factors, training classification algorithms, and evaluating predictive performance. The goal is to proactively identify which flights are likely to be delayed and understand key contributing factors.

## 🔄 Workflow Summary

### 1. Data Collection

Acquired flight schedule data including attributes such as: airline, origin, destination, scheduled departure, actual departure, delay flag, day/time of week, weather/airport hub features.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Proportion of flights delayed vs on-time
* Delay distribution across carriers, origins, destinations, and time windows
* Visualization of delay patterns by day of week/time of day
* Correlation and feature relationships

### 3. Feature Engineering

* Encoding categorical variables (airline, origin/destination airports)
* Creating time-based features (hour, day, weekend/weekdays)
* Delay history or lag features if available
* Binning of scheduled time or seasonal categorization
* Scaling numerical variables for modeling

### 4. Modeling

Classification models deployed:

* **Logistic Regression** (baseline)
* **Random Forest Classifier** (strong performer)
* **(Optional) Gradient Boosting / XGBoost** for enhanced accuracy

### 5. Evaluation

Key performance metrics:

* Accuracy
* Precision, Recall, F1-Score
* Confusion Matrix
* ROC-AUC

**Result:** The Random Forest (or chosen ensemble) model delivered the highest predictive performance, highlighting that features such as origin–destination pair, scheduled hour, and airline carrier are significant delay predictors.

### 6. Prediction & Insights

* Generated delay-predictions for new flight entries
* Extracted feature importances to reveal major delay drivers
* Recommended proactive scheduling and operational adjustments based on findings



## 📈 Key Findings

* Flights departing during peak hours and from congested airports exhibited higher delay probabilities
* Certain carriers and origin–destination pairs showed consistent delay patterns
* Temporal features (hour of day, day of week) were strong predictors
* Feature engineering significantly improved classification accuracy compared to raw features

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Incorporate external parameters like real-time weather, air traffic control constraints, or aircraft turnaround times
* Use time-series modeling or deep learning (e.g., LSTM with historical sequences)
* Implement hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV or automated tools
* Deploy as a real-time API dashboard using Flask or Streamlit to help schedulers predict delays operationally
* Expand dataset to include multiple years, countries, and carriers for improved generalization
